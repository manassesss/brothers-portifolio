## :drum: Project
This is a portfolio I made for my brother. He is a professional musician and he has accumulated some work that I thought needed to be gathered together and shown. So I decided to create this simple landing page to show everything he has done so far and how amazing of a professional he is.

## :notes: Design
To build the landing page, I asked him for some photos and some colors stood out a lot. So I thought of something like night and projector lights, that's when I chose the colors to compose the website. For the font, I chose my favorite to work with and that was it, I already had my palette and font.

After that, I started structuring and creating images for the landing page. This part was super fun! The end result looked like this:

If you click on the link to the deployment I made on Vercel, you will see that when I was programming, I took the liberty of adding more sessions to the landing page.
